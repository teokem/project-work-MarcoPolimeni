@page example_twobody Example: Osmotic Second Virial Coefficient

In this example we calculate the potential of mean force between
two rigid bodies with a fluctuating charge distribution. Salt and
solvent are implicitly treated using a Debye-Huckel potential and
the rigid bodies (here proteins) are kept on a line and allowed to
translate, rotate, and protons are kept in equilibrium with bulk
using particle swap moves.

During simulation we simply sample the probability of observing
the two bodies at a specific separation.
As the proteins are confined onto a line, each volume element along
`r` is constant and there's thus no need to normalize with a spherical
shell as done for freely moving particles.
The minimum and maximum allowed distance between the two bodies can
specified via the `Faunus::Energy::MassCenterConstrain` term in the
Hamiltonian.

Run this example from the `examples` directory:
The python script `twobody.py` generates the simulation input files
and all changes to the simulation setup should be done from inside
the script.
This example can run with the following (the first, optional
command checks out a specific commit with which this tutorial was created),

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ (git checkout 3cbc360e7af0a8ef57e5abe687fed61517eee516)
$ make example_twobody
$ cd src/examples
$ python twobody.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For calculating the virial coefficient, @f$B_2@f$, the angularly averaged
radial distribution function, g(r), must be integrated according to,

@f[ B_2 = -2\pi \int_0^{\infty} [ g(r) -1 ] r^2 dr @f]

where it should be noted that noise at large separations is strongly
amplified. To fix this, the tail of the g(r) can be fitted to
a Yukawa potential of the form (see [doi:10/xqw](http://dx.doi.org/10/xqw)),

@f[ w(r)/k_BT = -\ln g(r) = \lambda_B s^2 z_iz_j / r \exp{(-\kappa r )}  @f]

where @f$ s=\sinh{(a\kappa)}/a\kappa @f$ scales the charges due to spreading
them over a sphere with effective radius, `a`.
The fitting can be done using the supplied python script `twobody.virial.py` which
require information about protein charges, fitting range, and Debye length.
Edit and run with,

~~~~
$ python twobody.virial.py
~~~~
(requires `scipy` and `matplotlib`)

The output could look like below, and it is important to ensure
that the fitted parameters (Debye length or effective radius or both)
are in the vicinity of the simulated system.
Note that in the
limit @f$ a\kappa \rightarrow 0 @f$, i.e. when the Debye length
is much bigger then the particle size, @f$ s \rightarrow 1 @f$
and fitting via the effective radius, @f$ a @f$, is unfeasible
and should be disabled in the script.

visualize the fit.

twobody.cpp
===========
This is the underlying C++ program where one should note that the
pair potential is hard coded but can naturally be customised to
any potential from namespace `Faunus::Potential`.
